# Ladda

Buttons with built-in loading indicators, effectively bridging the gap between action and feedback. This is a fork of the original work done by: [Hakim El Hattab](https://github.com/hakimel). Check out the original project at: [github.com/hakimel/Ladda](https://github.com/hakimel/Ladda).

I've taken Hakim's original code and customized it to work with Twitter Bootstrap 3.1.1 

There's a blog post over at **insert here** explaining the customizations and how to integrate them into your Bootstrap projects.
